        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like reading because it increases your vocabulary and your knowledge of how to correctly use new words, reading helps you clearly articulate what you want to say. The knowledge you gain from reading also gives you lots to talk about with others. Whenever I get freetime, I always find myself reading a book. I am a 10 year old and study in class 5.</p>
